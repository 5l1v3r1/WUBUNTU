# WUBUNTU

wubuntu has been created cause it sucks and it's a waste of time to install and configuring a basic ubuntu server over and over again if you doing many installations in a short period so therefor I wrote tihs script so I can spend my time for something better then reinstall everything I already have done like 1000 times. Hopefully someone else will have some use for this script.

     git clone https://github.com/wuseman/WUBUNTU
