- Update (Update repo, upgrade packages, auto remove old packages and then clean up)
- Openvpn-Server 
- Owncloud Server
- Wuseman - (All tools I want have installed after a fresh re-install)
- Letsencrypt (Certbot - Apache2 supported - Setup nginx within 20 seconds just edit the script)
- Eggdrop
- Initramfs (For crypted root partitions - All you need to do before this will work is to create a authorized_keys file)
- Bitlbee (incl facebook plugin)
- PZS-NG
- gGLTPD
- Lamp (apache2, mysql-server php)
- Wbruter
- Emagnet 
- Rar2fs
- Plex Media Server
